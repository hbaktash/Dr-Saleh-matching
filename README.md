Graph matching algorithms on Erdos-Renyi models

Several algorithms implemented in python to apply on graphs generated by Erdos-Renyi model.
Initially a graph G is generated using the Erdos-Renyi model with parameters (n,p). Then G_1 and G_2 are obtained from G, with keeping edges of G with probability s (when s=1 the problem is the isomorphism problem).
In the matching problem G_1 and G_2 are given without initial labels (or randomly permuted) and the algorithm will try to obtain the permutation corresponding to actual matching labels.
